Notes: When last month's American Crossword Puzzle Tournament was postponed on account of the coronavirus pandemic, two crossword enthusiasts, Kevin Der and Finn Vigeland, quickly set up an online event to take its place. Nearly 2,000 people took part from home. This is the final puzzle. The tournament's other puzzles remain available online at no cost.
