Notes: Correction: An earlier version of this puzzle included an incorrect clue for 39-Down. While the author J.R.R. Tolkien had considered using 39-Down as the language spoken by characters in Middle-earth, according to "The Book of Lost Tales," he did not use it in his "Lord of the Rings" series.
